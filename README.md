Welcome to my Internship Repository!
This repository will serve as a central place where I will document and upload all the major tasks, exercises, and learning assignments given to me by my team lead throughout my internship.

Before I am assigned a full real-world project, I will be completing multiple preparatory tasks to strengthen my technical understanding, improve my workflow, and get familiar with the tools, technologies, and processes used by the team. All such tasks will be added here in an organized manner.

Purpose of This Repository

Track my progress throughout the internship

Maintain a record of all assigned tasks

Showcase my learning curve and skill development

Keep everything organized before transitioning to real project work

# Internship Repository

Welcome to my **Internship Repository**!

This repository is where I will be adding all the major tasks assigned to me by my team lead throughout my internship. These tasks will help me build the necessary skills, understand the workflow, and get familiar with the tools and technologies used by the team before I am assigned a real project.


## Purpose of This Repository
- Keep track of my progress during the internship  
- Maintain a structured record of all assigned tasks  
- Document my learning and technical growth  
- Prepare myself before moving on to an actual project  


## Repository Structure
The structure will be gradually updated as more tasks are completed:
